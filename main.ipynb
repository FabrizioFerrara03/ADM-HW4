    "#### Correctness of the Algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)* is correct because it ensures that both players, Arya and Mario, play optimally. By reformulating the problem using **dynamic programming**, it divides the task into subproblems of smaller size, each representing the maximum score Arya can achieve for a given range $[first, last]$ of the sequence. The subproblems are defined by the range $[first, last]$ of the sequence. Each subproblem depends only on smaller subproblems, ensuring that the overlapping subproblem property is satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let *OPT(first, last)* represent the maximum score Arya can achieve if the current range of the sequence is from index *first* to *last*, assuming both players play optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Base Cases**: \n",
    "1. If the range of indices is invalid (*first > last*) or *nums* is empty, the algorithm returns $0$ because no numbers are left to pick:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "OPT(first, last) = 0, \\quad \\text{if } first > last.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "2. If there is only one number in the range (*first == last*), the algorithm returns that number because Arya has no choice but to pick it:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "OPT(first, last) = \\text{nums}[first], \\quad \\text{if } first = last\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Recursive Case**: For each recursive call, Arya has two choices:\n",
    "1. **Pick the first number (*nums[first]*)**: After Arya picks *nums[first]*, Mario chooses optimally to minimize Arya's future score. This is handled by taking the **minimum** of the two possible outcomes: \n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+2, last]* if Mario picks *nums[first+1]*.\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+1, last-1]* if Mario picks *nums[last]*.\n",
    "   Thus, Arya's score becomes:\n",
    "   \\begin{align*}\n",
    "   \\text{nums}[first] + \\min(OPT(first + 2, last), OPT(first + 1, last - 1)).\n",
    "   \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pick the last number (*nums[last]*)**: After Arya picks *nums[last]*, Mario again minimizes Arya's future score by choosing the best option for himself:\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+1, last-1]* if Mario picks *nums[first]*.\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first, last-2]* if Mario picks *nums[last-1]*.\n",
    "   Similarly to the previous case, Similarly, Arya's score becomes:\n",
    "   \\begin{align*}\n",
    "   \\text{nums}[last] + \\min(OPT(first + 1, last - 1), OPT(first, last - 2)).\n",
    "   \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Optimal Strategy**: To ensure that Arya maximizes her score, the algorithm selects the **maximum** of the two possible scores:\n",
    "1. The score if Arya picks the first number;\n",
    "2. The score if Arya picks the last number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Arya's best score can be formalized as:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "OPT(first, last) = \\max(\\text{nums}[first] + \\min(OPT(first + 2, last), OPT(first + 1, last - 1)), \\text{nums}[last] + \\min(OPT(first + 1, last - 1), OPT(first, last - 2))).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Winning Determination**: Finally, the algorithm *isAryaWinner(nums)* determines the winner by performing the following steps:\n",
    "1. Computing Arya's score using *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)*;\n",
    "2. Calculating Mario's score as the difference between the total sum of numbers and Arya's score;\n",
    "3. Returning *True* if Arya's score is greater or equal to Mario's score, and *False* otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness of *isAryaWinnerExp(nums)* is directly tied to the correctness of *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)*, as the latter ensures Arya’s score is optimally calculated for any range of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the combination of *maximizeAryaScoreExp* and *isAryaWinnerExp* guarantees correctness because:\n",
    "- Arya's optimal strategy is computed for every possible range of numbers;\n",
    "- The comparison in *isAryaWinner* accurately determines the winner based on the scores of Arya and Mario."

    "### c) Is the algorithm efficient? Prove that it is polynomial and provide an asymptotic time complexity bound, or show that it requires exponential time.\n",

    "The algorithm is inefficient because it requires exponential time. This inefficiency stems from the function *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, which dominates the overall complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function *isAryaWinnerExp*, excluding the call to the recursive algorithm *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array *nums*. Specifically, this bound depends on how the length of *nums* is calculated. For instance, in Python, the length of a list is stored as an attribute, making this operation $O(1)$. However, in a more general implementation, determining the length may require counting each element, resulting in $O(n)$. Beyond that, *isAryaWinnerExp* performs basic operations such as subtraction and comparison, both of which take constant time $O(1)$. Therefore, the overall time complexity of *isAryaWinnerExp* is dominated by the recursive function *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, which requires exponential time.\n",

Specifically, it ensures correctness by systematically building the solution for the entire problem from the solutions to its subproblems, leveraging **dynamic programming** to iteratively compute the optimal score for progressively larger ranges. This iterative approach guarantees that, when solving a subproblem for the range $[first,last]$, the optimal solutions for all smaller subproblems ($[first+2, last]$, $[first+1, last-1]$, $[first, last-2]$) have already been computed and stored in the *scores* table, ultimately leading to the correct computation of $OPT[0, n-1]$.\n",

By mirroring the recursive structure of the exponential algorithm and adhering to the same minimization and maximization principles, the computed results for each range are guaranteed to be optimal. Iterating over subproblem sizes in increasing order ensures every required subproblem is solved before being used, avoiding redundancy and culminating in $OPT[0,n-1]$, the solution to the original problem.\n",

    "\n",
