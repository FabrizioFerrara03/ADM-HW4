    "#### Correctness of the Algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)* is correct because it ensures that both players, Arya and Mario, play optimally, and it recursively computes the maximum score Arya can achieve based on the given rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Base Cases**: \n",
    "1. If the range of indices is invalid (*first > last*) or *nums* is empty, the algorithm returns $0$ because no numbers are left to pick.\n",
    "2. If there is only one number in the range (*first == last*), the algorithm returns that number because Arya has no choice but to pick it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Recursive Case**: For each recursive call, Arya has two choices:\n",
    "1. **Pick the first number (*nums[first]*)**: After Arya picks *nums[first]*, Mario chooses optimally to minimize Arya's future score. This is handled by taking the **minimum** of the two possible outcomes:\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+2, last]* if Mario picks *nums[first+1]*.\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+1, last-1]* if Mario picks *nums[last]*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pick the last number (*nums[last]*)**: After Arya picks *nums[last]*, Mario again minimizes Arya's future score by choosing the best option for himself:\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+1, last-1]* if Mario picks *nums[first]*.\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first, last-2]* if Mario picks *nums[last-1]*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Optimal Strategy**: To ensure that Arya maximizes her score, the algorithm selects the **maximum** of the two possible scores:\n",
    "1. The score if Arya picks the first number;\n",
    "2. The score if Arya picks the last number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Winning Determination**: Finally, the algorithm *isAryaWinner(nums)* determines the winner by performing the following steps:\n",
    "1. Computing Arya's score using *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)*;\n",
    "2. Calculating Mario's score as the difference between the total sum of numbers and Arya's score;\n",
    "3. Returning *True* if Arya's score is greater or equal to Mario's score, and *False* otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness of *isAryaWinnerExp(nums)* is directly tied to the correctness of *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)*, as the latter ensures Aryaâ€™s score is optimally calculated for any range of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the combination of *maximizeAryaScoreExp* and *isAryaWinnerExp* guarantees correctness because:\n",
    "- Arya's optimal strategy is computed for every possible range of numbers;\n",
    "- The comparison in *isAryaWinner* accurately determines the winner based on the scores of Arya and Mario."

    "\n",
    "The algorithm is inefficient because it requires exponential time. This inefficiency stems from the function *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, which dominates the overall complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function *isAryaWinnerExp*, excluding the call to the recursive algorithm *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array *nums*. Specifically, this bound depends on how the length of *nums* is calculated. For instance, in Python, the length of a list is stored as an attribute, making this operation $O(1)$. However, in a more general implementation, determining the length may require counting each element, resulting in $O(n)$. Beyond that, *isAryaWinnerExp* performs basic operations such as subtraction and comparison, both of which take constant time $O(1)$. Therefore, the overall time complexity of *isAryaWinnerExp* is dominated by the recursive function *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, which requires exponential time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the function *maximizeAryaScoreExp* is called:\n",

    "&= 4^2 \\cdot T(n-2 \\cdot 2) + (4^0 + 4^1) \\cdot c \\\\\n",
