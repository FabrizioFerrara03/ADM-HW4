    "#### Correctness of the Algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)* is correct because it ensures that both players, Arya and Mario, play optimally. By reformulating the problem using **dynamic programming**, it divides the task into subproblems of smaller size, each representing the maximum score Arya can achieve for a given range $[first, last]$ of the sequence. The subproblems are defined by the range $[first, last]$ of the sequence. Each subproblem depends only on smaller subproblems, ensuring that the overlapping subproblem property is satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let *OPT(first, last)* represent the maximum score Arya can achieve if the current range of the sequence is from index *first* to *last*, assuming both players play optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Base Cases**: \n",
    "1. If the range of indices is invalid (*first > last*) or *nums* is empty, the algorithm returns $0$ because no numbers are left to pick:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "OPT(first, last) = 0, \\quad \\text{if } first > last.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "2. If there is only one number in the range (*first == last*), the algorithm returns that number because Arya has no choice but to pick it:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "OPT(first, last) = \\text{nums}[first], \\quad \\text{if } first = last\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Recursive Case**: For each recursive call, Arya has two choices:\n",
    "1. **Pick the first number (*nums[first]*)**: After Arya picks *nums[first]*, Mario chooses optimally to minimize Arya's future score. This is handled by taking the **minimum** of the two possible outcomes: \n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+2, last]* if Mario picks *nums[first+1]*.\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+1, last-1]* if Mario picks *nums[last]*.\n",
    "   Thus, Arya's score becomes:\n",
    "   \\begin{align*}\n",
    "   \\text{nums}[first] + \\min(OPT(first + 2, last), OPT(first + 1, last - 1)).\n",
    "   \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pick the last number (*nums[last]*)**: After Arya picks *nums[last]*, Mario again minimizes Arya's future score by choosing the best option for himself:\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first+1, last-1]* if Mario picks *nums[first]*.\n",
    "     - Arya continues with the range *[first, last-2]* if Mario picks *nums[last-1]*.\n",
    "   Similarly to the previous case, Similarly, Arya's score becomes:\n",
    "   \\begin{align*}\n",
    "   \\text{nums}[last] + \\min(OPT(first + 1, last - 1), OPT(first, last - 2)).\n",
    "   \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Optimal Strategy**: To ensure that Arya maximizes her score, the algorithm selects the **maximum** of the two possible scores:\n",
    "1. The score if Arya picks the first number;\n",
    "2. The score if Arya picks the last number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Arya's best score can be formalized as:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "OPT(first, last) = \\max(\\text{nums}[first] + \\min(OPT(first + 2, last), OPT(first + 1, last - 1)), \\text{nums}[last] + \\min(OPT(first + 1, last - 1), OPT(first, last - 2))).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Winning Determination**: Finally, the algorithm *isAryaWinner(nums)* determines the winner by performing the following steps:\n",
    "1. Computing Arya's score using *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)*;\n",
    "2. Calculating Mario's score as the difference between the total sum of numbers and Arya's score;\n",
    "3. Returning *True* if Arya's score is greater or equal to Mario's score, and *False* otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness of *isAryaWinnerExp(nums)* is directly tied to the correctness of *maximizeAryaScoreExp(nums, first, last)*, as the latter ensures Arya’s score is optimally calculated for any range of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the combination of *maximizeAryaScoreExp* and *isAryaWinnerExp* guarantees correctness because:\n",
    "- Arya's optimal strategy is computed for every possible range of numbers;\n",
    "- The comparison in *isAryaWinner* accurately determines the winner based on the scores of Arya and Mario."

    "### c) Is the algorithm efficient? Prove that it is polynomial and provide an asymptotic time complexity bound, or show that it requires exponential time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is inefficient because it requires exponential time. This inefficiency stems from the function *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, which dominates the overall complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function *isAryaWinnerExp*, apart from the call to the recursive algorithm *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array *nums*. This complexity arises from calculating the total sum of all numbers in *nums* and determining the length of the array. For instance, in Python, the length of a list is stored as an attribute, making this operation $O(1)$. However, in a more general implementation, determining the length may require counting each element, resulting in $O(n)$. Beyond that, *isAryaWinnerExp* performs basic operations such as subtraction and comparison, both of which take constant time $O(1)$. Therefore, the overall time complexity of *isAryaWinnerExp* is dominated by the recursive function *maximizeAryaScoreExp*, which requires exponential time.\n",

Specifically, it ensures correctness by systematically building the solution for the entire problem from the solutions to its subproblems, leveraging **dynamic programming** to iteratively compute the optimal score for progressively larger ranges. This iterative approach guarantees that, when solving a subproblem for the range $[first,last]$, the optimal solutions for all smaller subproblems ($[first+2, last]$, $[first+1, last-1]$, $[first, last-2]$) have already been computed and stored in the *scores* table, ultimately leading to the correct computation of $OPT[0, n-1]$.\n",

Iterating over subproblem sizes in increasing order ensures every required subproblem is solved before being used, avoiding redundancy and culminating in $OPT[0,n-1]$, the solution to the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness of *isAryaWinnerPol(nums)* follows directly from the correctness of *maximizeAryaScorePol(nums)*, using the same reasoning as in the exponential case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall complexity of *isAryaWinnerPol(nums)* is primarily determined by the time complexity of the *maximizeAryaScorePol(nums)* function. Let us analyze this step by step:\n",
    "- Calculating the total sum of all numbers in *nums* takes $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of *nums*;\n",
    "- Subtraction and comparison operations are constant time $O(1)$.\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $T(n)$ is the time complexity of *maximizeAryaScorePol(nums)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us analyze the complexity of *maximizeAryaScorePol(nums)* in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Computing the length of *nums* takes $O(n)$, as explained in the analysis for the exponential algorithm;\n",
    "   - Creating an $n \\times n$ matrix initialized with zeros takes $O(n^2)$;\n",
    "   - The first loop that sets the diagonal entries $scores[i][i] = nums[i]$ also takes $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nested Loops for Dynamic Programming Table Filling**: The nested loops iteratively fill the dynamic programming table. In particular:\n",
    "     - The **outer loop** iterates over lengths of subarrays from 2 to $n$, contributing $O(n)$;\n",
    "     - For each length, the **inner loop** iterates over starting indices of subarrays, contributing $O(n - \\text{length})$ for each length.\n",
    "     - **Per-Iteration Operations**, i.e., accessing values in the matrix and performing comparisons and arithmetic operations, take $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "     For a fixed value of $length$, the inner loop performs $O(n - \\text{length})$ iterations. As $length$ varies from 2 to $n$, the total number of iterations across all loops can be computed as:\n",
    "     \\begin{align*}\n",
    "     \\sum_{\\text{length}=2}^{n} \\sum_{\\text{first}=0}^{n-\\text{length}} O(1) = O(n^2).\n",
    "     \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Return**: Returning $scores[0][n-1]$ takes $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all the components, we obtain:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

For example, a sequence of length $30$ takes over $\\mathbf{252}$ **seconds**, making the exponential approach impractical for inputs of this size or larger.

For single-element subarrays, Arya can only pick the single element, so the value of $dp[i][i]$ is simply $nums[i]$. For larger subarrays, the algorithm recursively computes the maximum score difference based on Arya's two possible moves: picking the first element, resulting in $nums[i] - dp[i+1][j]$, or picking the last element, resulting in $nums[j] - dp[i][j-1]$.

If this value is non-negative, Arya can ensure her score is at least equal to Mario's, and the algorithm returns *True*, otherwise it returns *False*.\n",
